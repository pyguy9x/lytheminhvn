My code and example

# Rule of name

- `demo_file_`name.py : test, demo file

- `file_name0,1,2,..`.py: not perfect, may be has error
- `file_name`.py: not perfect, has error and need to optimize

- `file_name_good`.py: perfect, no error (may be ok)

- **Target** : `file_name_final.py` => excellent, no error and good pep8 formatting

- file name **MUST** clear and `easy to understand`.

# Rule of folder

- One project - one folder
- /test, /test_code : **All** test files in here
