Fuck Wolverine.
First, he rides my coattailswith the R rating.
Then the hairy motherfuckerups the ante by dying.
What a dick.
Well, guess what, Wolvie?
I'm dying in this one, too.
To understandwhy I took a cat-nap
on 1,200 gallonsof high-test fuel...
I need to take you back
to the dewy slopesof six weeks ago.
I'd gone international,
taking out mass murderers,gangsters,
unspeakable monsters.
People nobody would touch.Except me.
I'm gonna touch them all over.
Hey, it's Gail calling.
Love the shiny suit.
Really brings out
the sex traffickerin your eyes.
I don'tspeak Cantonese, Mister...
Well, I'm not even gonnaattempt that.
But I did take 8th grade Spanish, so...
Which literallytranslates to...
I don't bargain,pumpkin fucker.
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.
I am so sorry.
I thought this wasan anal-bleaching party.
Don't worry.You're not going to die.
Although these will kill you.
Hit it, Dolly.
I'm merelya vessel for the Lord.
Taking the hands outof the guns of the criminals!
Whoo! Do not go in there!
Let's seeCaptain America do that.
Too exotic?
Oh, God! Oh, God,time out! Time out!
Cut. I've got bad guy blood,right in my open eye.
Oh, that's so gross.
Fuck.
Looks like you lefta little landing strip there.
I like it.
Oh, man!
My world tourbrought me home
to this guy,Sergei Valishnikov.
But we'll get to himin a moment.
'Cause I knowwhat you're thinking.
"I'm so gladI left the kiddos at home."
But that's whereyou'd be wrong.
That babysitter of yoursis high as fuck right now...
and, believe it or not,Deadpool 2 is a family film.
True story.
And every good family filmstarts with a vicious murder.
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.
Holy shit pickles!That guy's on fire.
That's not CGI, folks.He's actually on fire.
Yeah. You know I get paidto take out bad guys, right?
But this guy?
He wasone of the worst of 'em.
Hurry up and openthis fucking door,
and let's killthis motherfucker!
Ugh. So gross.
A panic room? Really?
Can you come out?
I really have to go.It's my anniversary.
Over and over,I hear people say,
"I just don't haveenough confidence."
Listen, confidence is notsomething you have.
It's something you create.
And you can create itat any moment in time.
A sense of confidenceis nothing
but a sense of powerwithin yourself...
a sense of certainty thatyou can pull something off.
Start the fucking car!
Dopinder!
Start the fucking car!
Shoot that motherfucker!Shoot him!
Whoo! Oh, I shit my pants.
Actually, that mayhave been me.
Oh, mission accomplished?
Oh, in a George W.sort of way.
Fucker can't stayin a panic room forever.
Oh, you're livingthe dreams, DP.
It has beenquite the run, Dopinder,
and who'da thought?
Now I'm talked aboutin the same sentence as Jesus.
Passion of the Christ, then me.
At least domestically.
We beat them overseas,
where there's no such thingas religion.
I do want to livethe dreams, Pool Boy.
Taxiing is not as sexyas it looks.
I want to fill my... Pockets?
What's your poison?A little, uh, cokey cokey?
Can't maintain an erection
without buying shoes online?
I've never experiencedthat last one.
Talk to me, Goose.
I was going to say "soul".I want to fill my soul.
I want to belong to something,like you, Pool, sir.
Dopinder... Hmm?
You never ceaseto surprise me.
You know, the depth ofyour heart is extraordinary.
We all needa sense of belonging.
We all needa genuine sense of home.
A place in this world.
I want to becomea contract killer.
I'm sorry. What did you say?
Remember whenI kidnapped Bandhu
and threatened himwith great violence?
You kind of killed him.
And then remember the movieInterview with the Vampire?
Don't want to.
When Tom Cruise fed
10-year-oldKirsten Dunst blood
for the first time...
and she looked upat his smooth,
handsome face and said...
"I want some more."
Oh, Pool, picture me,a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.
I'll never not picture that.
But I can't waitto never speak of this,
as soon as possible.
We're here.
Dopinder, it's me again.
Look, a saner manmight discourage you
from joiningthe deadly merc business...
what, with your concave chest
and yourpaper towel tube arms.
But you're an eagle...
and goddamn it,an eagle's gotta soar.
You gotta grab those dreams,
grab those dreamsby the dick tip...
and make it rain!
I don't know what that means.
Me neither.
I'm gonna see you...
at the office.
In the sky.
You're my Tom Cruise!
And you're my Kristen Dunst!
Kristen? Kirsten?
Sorry I'm late.
There was a bunch of
handicapable childrenstuck in a tree...
and I had to, uh... Uh-uh.
You're right.I was fighting a caped badass.
But then we discoveredhis mom is named Martha, too.
No.You got me.
I was rounding upall the gluten in the world
and launching it into space...
where it can't nothurt us ever again.
Try again.
Diarrhea?
We can't be sureuntil I get this suit off...
but, uh,all signs point to yes.
Traffic?
Hmm?
Kiss melike you miss me, Red.
Well, come here.
I'm gonna showerand get out of this suit.
Don't you wantyour surprise?
Do I look likea patient burn victim?
I got one for you, too.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Open, open, open.
Skee-Ball token.
Our first date.
Yup.
That's genuine,high-grade lead.
I'll keep it forever.
Thank you, baby.
Open yours. All right, all right.
Oh...
That's just the mostbeautiful thing that I've...
I don't knowwhat this is.
My IUD.
A bomb?
No, dick for brains.My birth control device.
What, you mean that your...
Baby factory's openfor business.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! I want a boy!
Or a little girl!Definitely one or the other!
Oh! And I want our kidto have only one name.
Like Cher or Todd.
You gotta pump a babyin me first, cowboy.
Yes, I do.
Let's watch some pornand show that bed who's boss.
Let's do that.
♪ Papa... ♪
♪ Can you hear me? ♪
♪ Papa, can you see me? ♪
Does this songsound familiar to you?
May.
Connor, if it's a boy.May, if it's a girl.
So weird.
Family was alwaysan F-word to me.
My pile of shit fathertook off and bailed.
I mean, it's not like I havea lot of strong role models
to draw off of for Todd.
Hey. Look at me.
You are not your father.
Besides...
I will never, everlet our child be named Todd.
But here's the thing,
isn't that howit always works?
Like in Star Wars,
men are destinedto become their father...
and then have consensual sexwith their sister?
I think you missedbig, big chunks of that movie.
No, I'm pretty sureLuke nailed her.
Baby, that's Empire.
The point is, kids...
they give us a chanceto be better than we are.
Better than we used to be.
You're a lot smarterthan I look.
I'm gonna go make dessert.
You get the strap-on.Let's make a super baby.
Pretty sure it doesn't workthat way, but we can try.
What about Krystal?But with a "K"?
It's too stripper-y.
Kevin with a "K"!
No, too stripper-y, too.
Uh, Earl!
He's gonna go straight to jail
if we name him Earl.
What about Bruce?
No.
Get down.
What?
Baby? Baby?
I'm okay.
Thank God I didn't have to usethe cream cheese spreader.
Please.
Please. Please.
Baby, I'm so sorry.
No!
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪
Is it just me, or does
Do You Want to Builda Snowman? from Frozen...

Papa, Can You Hear Me?from Yentl?
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪
And nobodyfucking realizes it.
Wade, you gotta go home.
You've been sitting herefor three days, okay?
You smell like sauerkrautleft in the warm rain.
Like wet garbagein hot urine.
You smell likea dog ate kitty litter...
and then farted his wayout of the living room.
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's
couch cushionsafter Shark Week.
I love Frozen.
I loved her. I loved herlike an ocean loves water.
An ocean is water.
More importantly, I liked her.I really liked her, you know?
George Michael was right.
I'm never gonnadance again. Fuck!
He's dead, too.
At least we still have Bowie.
Oh, Mr. Pool.David Bowie is...
Uh, uh, uh...
still with us.
We do.We'll always have Bowie.
I'm sorry.
Shot after shot,
it's not gonna change the factthat I think you're...
Are you pissing?Are you urinating right now?
You're making the face thatyou make when you urinate.
Is he pissing? I'm on it!
There you go, Dopinder.
If you want to bea contract killer...
you gotta handle a mopbefore you handle a gun.
Although I don'tquite understand
how they are at all similar.
'Cause I could shove eitherone up your ass and kill you.
Now, leave me.
I get it.
Go home, Wade.
I don't have a home,Weas, you know. I got a...
Okay, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
You know what "fine"stands for, Wade?
Fucked up, insecure,needy, and emotional.
According to the...
Kubler-Ross.Yeah.
According tothe Kubler-Ross model...
denial is just one ofthe five stages of grief.
Jesus Christ, Buck!
No more speaking linesfor you.
Hey, bud. Bud.
Huh?Got a match?
Match?
Yes, I have one right here.
Don't make a move.This is a stick-up.
What?You heard me.
Mister, Mister,put down that gun.
Shut up. Now, come on.Your money or your life?
Look, bud. I said,"Your money or your life."
"I'm thinking it over!"
Motherfuck!
Fuck!
The hell you doin' here?
Don't you know how to knock?
I thought you saw me...
with your ears.
You're lucky I didn'tshoot you in the...
The wall?
The refrigerator?I'm in so much pain.
I heard the news,sweetie.
I'm very sorry. I am.
What am I gonna do, Al?
Probably something terrible.
Knowing you.
It was my fault.
I fucking did this.
And all I wanna dois grab her and see her
and tell her that I'm sorry,and I can't.
She's gone.
Sweetheart,can you speak up?
It's a little hardto hear you
with that pity dickin your mouth.
Now, look, sugar.You need to just keep living.
Thank you...
Matthew McConaughey,your words are a treasure.
Listen to the pain.
It's both history teacherand fortune teller.
Pain teaches uswho we are, Wade.
Sometimes, it's so bad,we feel like we're dying.
But we can't really live tillwe've died a little, can we?
Wade?
Wade? I'm right here, Althea.
And that isthe most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.
And you're absolutely right.
I'm about to dosomething terrible.
Precious, aren't they?
Whoa!
Are you a superhero?
Fucking A, sweetie.
What's your name?
Captain Delicious Pants.
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?
I can't believehe's still alive.
I can't believe you leftthe house in that shirt.
There's gotta besome way to die.
I just need to die harder.
Trademark Fox.
Y'all caught up now?
Open for business.
Your crazymatches my crazy.
I will never, everlet our child be named Todd.
Skee-Ball token.
You're a lot smarterthan I look.
About whywe're so good together.
I love you,Wade Wilson.
Ness?
Ness?
Ness.
Ness, there's something here.I can't get to you.
Your heart's notin the right place.
Wait, hold on. What?
Your heart's notin the right place.
Wait. What do you mean
my heart's not in the rightplace? What does it...
I'm terribly sorryfor your loss, Wade.
You're broken.
Oh, God.I know that voice.
Well, Russell.
I hear you're handyat picking locks.
There will be no needfor that here.
There's no locks on our doors,no bars on our windows.
I know what you're thinking.
Why don't the kids just run?
Who would choose to stayin such a place?
You stay because...
deep down inside, you knowyou're unfit to leave.
Don't worry.
We can fix that.
Blessed are the wickedwho are healed by my hand.
"Heart's in the right place."
"Heart's in the right..."What does that mean?
Take your mask off, Wade.
I wish you'd said "pants".
Let's play a game.
It's called"Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".
Now, close your eyesand open your mouth.
You don't needto be funny here.
We must talk.
You need fresh start.
Such a glare.
It's like I'm on stageat the Gaiety.
With training,you can be X-Man.
You're wasting your time,Shiny Jesus.
I'm not X-Man material.
Understatement of the year.
Wade, Yukio.
Yukio, Wade.
What in the fuck knucklesis this?
She's my girlfriend,you intolerant shit.
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes,Fox & Friends.
I'm just surprisedanyone would date you.
Especially Pinkie Piefrom My Little Pony.
I like this guy.
Give him a chance.
It's great seeing youlike this.
Yeah.
Bye, Wade!
Now, some ground ruleswhile under our roof.
"Rule number one.No killing...
"anyone ever,no matter how bad.
"Rule two. Label everythingin refrigerator."
Wade?
Wade?
Don't try to chase me. Wade!
I'm not readyto be touched again.
All these old guyson the wall.
Who lives here,Calista Flockhart?
Those were already damagedafter they fell there!
What am I supposedto do around here, anyway?
Sit in a share circle,talk about my feelings?
And how would Ido that exactly?
'Cause where the fuckis everyone?
It's always just you
and Negasonic TeenageLongest Name Ever...
Enough!
I said no touching!
What the fuck?
You'd think the studiowould throw us a bone.
One that doesn't end upin my mouth.
The first moviemade more money
than the guywho invented pants.
They can't just dust offone of the famous X-Men?
How 'bout that putzwith the giant pigeon wings?
What do those do anyway, huh?
Carry himthree feet off the ground
to snatch upthe nearest muffin crumb?
No, no, no!
I am not X-Man materialat all.
First off...
I'm not even a virgin.Second and more...
I should have left you
in the self-pitying messI found you in.
But this is what friends do.They show up!
Not when convenient or easy.
When hard,and you always make it hard.
You are unwell.
I'm sticking my neck outbringing you here.
Wait.One of the assholes
who killed Vanessa got away.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
I thought you were gonnakiss me for a second there.
Please know I wouldn't beable to stop you if you did.
Wade, whoever they are...
we track them downand bring them to justice.
It was me.
I'm the asshole who got away.
I killed every last oneof them, except me.
Couldn't kill me.
We were gonna start a family.
We were, uh...
We were gonna be a family.
Wade...
Vanessa is gone.She's not coming back.
This may not befamily you want...
but it's family you need.
You have a good heart.
It belongs herewhere it can grow.
What did you say?
About my heart?
I thinkI'm in the right place.
I'mma tell youwhat the big lie is.
Toilet paper.
What's so badabout toilet paper?
Gets the job done.
Does it reallyget the job done?
All right. Say you wake uptomorrow morning...
and, hypothetically, find somefresh shit on your face.
Your cheek, maybea little bit in the beard.
What the hell?I'm about to be fucking sick!
What do you do?
Do you go to a bathroom
and tear offa piece of dry tissue...
and rub it aroundon your beard a little bit
and then go on,get on with your day?
Go to church,maybe dinner and a movie,
like nothing happened?
Where is thiscoming from, man?
But something did happen.
Your face smells like shit.Right?
So what you would do,
is you would get some soap,you'd get some hot water...
and you would scrubthe fucking shit
out of your beardfor 10 straight minutes.
You could notscrub it enough.
Are you tryingto make me feel disgusting?
I'm starting to feel...
Toilet paper isa pretty fine appetizer.
But, then...
Huggies Natural Carewet wipes.
That's your main course.
They're soft, they're moist.They're for babies.
Finally, one more passwith toilet paper,
maybe clear outthat excess moisture.
Maybe treat yourselfto a blow and go,
if you can get youa hair dryer.
Just about 30 secondswould do you good.
The fuck?
Year.
What?
What year is it?
What kind of dumbass questionis that to ask?
We have 8 weeks ofboot camp ahead of us, men.
That'll get ustoned and prepared
for all manner of combat.
Not working out at all.
Masking tape.
It is no friendto chilled aluminum.
Velcro.Color-coded, efficient,
environmentally friendly.
Who is he talking to?
And why is he dressed likea registered sex offender?
Can we focusfor a moment, ladies?
Please, we need to talk aboutnext month's meal plan.
Obviously,everyone hated the ceviche.
I read the suggestion box.
I'm gonna stop youright there.
I see through this weak act.
You may have fooled Colossuswith this nice guy shit...
but not me.
Don't be mean.
Back off, NTW.
No, no, no. Let her go.
Let her go, it's okay.
She has a rightto be skeptical.
Look at me.I'm an easy target.
You know, historically,
mischief has beenmy mistress...
so I understand, you know.But I like to think...
that you guys havereally rubbed off on me.
I like to think that I'verubbed off around you, too.
A lot.
And for the first timein a long while...
I like me.
I accept your apology. I never apologized.
I was talking to your heart.
See? You're notlost cause you thought.
I'm proud. You're everythingI knew you can be.
Thank you, Colossus.
Just trying to bethe world's best X-Man.
Sorry, X-Person.
Hmm. Something wrongwith the soap.
It's fine.
I just filled it. Give ita few more pumps there.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
it's dust bunny season...
and I'm hunting wabbits.
Bye, Wade!
Fuck.Fuck you.
No one is born perfect.
But you can be.
I know you're doingwhat comes naturally.
You can't help yourself.
But you can.
It takes work, discipline...
and treatment.
Your abilities...
I know how seductive they are.
How powerfulthey make you feel.
But you must learnnever to use them...
so they will never use you.
Please don't cry.
I'm going to help.
I'm gonna make you feelwhat you should feel.
How you need to feel...
every time you're temptedto act upon your urges.
Suck my mutant dick,you four-eyed fuck.
Wade.
Wade!
Come in!Hey, I was just doing
a little bitof light reading here...
We have mission.
Well, you guys besafe out there.
I'll be praying for you.
No, I want you to join.
I'm sorry, what?
You heard me.
Trust me,that's a terrible idea.
I'm really not ready.
You are ready. I'm not.
Be at the X-Jet in five.
I can do thirty.
Now. I can do now.
Final offer.
Irene Merryweather, WHIT News.
Live hereat a breaking news situation
at the Essex Housefor Mutant Rehabilitation.
A mutant boyis appearing to have
some sort of an incident...
with police here behind me.Get away from me!
There are two police vehiclesthat are overturned.
There are open fires. Fuck off! Stay back!
A scene ofabsolute chaos here.
Calm down.
I'll burn you!You stay back!
Get away from me!
You wanna fucking die?
And it appears as if the X-Menare arriving...
Scatter!
...with what appearsto be a trainee.
Everyone, calm down!The pros are here. I...
We're the X-Men!
A dated metaphor for racismin the '60s.
So, respect.
At ease, Officer.
What are you doing?
My job!
You're the one who saidI was ready,
and I frankly disagreedwith you.
But here we are, trying toovercome our differences.
Like Beyonce says, "Please...
"Please, stop cheating on me."
Hey!
This is the fifth incident.
This kid needs to bein the Ice Box, not here.
Russell belongs in our care.
Not in prison.I assure you...
we have everythingunder control.
Stay back!I'll burn you!
Not getting a real
"under control"vibe here, Marty.
It is Glen, isn't it? Daniel.
I'll ask the questions,Miguel.
Let me talk to the kid.
You stay here with your weird,secret sex lips.
You wanna die?
This kid's adorable.
I don't know why I packedthe hollow points.
I'll burn your balls off!
First day.I'm so nervous!
Did you just say"hollow points"?
Yeah, probably should've
brought a Super Soaker.
Hi, there!
Stay backor Justin Bieber dies!
Justin Bieber.He called you Justin Bieber.
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!
Okay, let's not dowhatever that is.
Okay? Let's just talk!
It's Russell, right?
Firefist.Firefist.
Ooh, that's a great name.Where does it burn?
Just the fist, or all the wayup to the elbow?
Definitely allthe way up to the elbow.
Come quietly,or there will be trouble.
You stole that from Robocop!That's from Robocop!
Just stand down!
You're embarrassing me.Look, Fire...
Oh, my God! I can't say it!I'm so sorry!
Oh, shit!That fucking does it!
Put your handsbehind your knees
and get downon your head! Now!
Wade! What was first rule?
Label everythingin the refrigerator!
Do not escalate!Rules are meant to be broken!
That's the exact opposite
of what they're meant for!
Fuck! Fine!
I'll start from the beginning.
My name is Deadpool,and I'm an X-Man.
Trainee! Shut it!
Look, I get it.
All right, you're scared.
Alone.
You got no family.
I didn't havea family, either.
You live in this dump.Guess what?
I used to live in a shitholejust like it.
But you know something?
A wise womanonce said to me...
"Speak up."
"I can't hear you with thatpity dick in your mouth."
Too much? I went too far.
That was effervescent.
Stay in school, kid.
Or don't. I didn't.
And I'm an X-Man.
Trainee.
Fuck it!
Superhero landing coming up!
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!
That is so not practical.
I could get usedto this X-Man shit.
Trainee!
Trainee!
Get a power restrainton him. Now!
Calm down, squirt.It's over. We got ya.
What's that do?
Power-dampening collar.
Shuts downall mutant abilities.
You can't get it off.Unless you've got a grenade.
Huh. Could've usedone of those in the first act.
Thank you!
That was absolutely thrilling.
True heroism in action.
We are in your debt.
We can take it from here.
Take meto the Ice Box, please!
Anywhere's better than here.
Believe me, son,
you do not wanna goto the Ice Box.
That place makes Hitler's anuslook like Waikiki.
Let's get you inside,young man.
No, wait, wait. Wait.
You guys stay there.
Those guys hurt you?
Who?
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?
Both of 'em?
Oh, fuck it.
Four or five moments!
I'm sorry?
Four or five moments!
That's all it takesto be a hero.
People thinkyou wake up a hero...
brush your teeth a hero...
ejaculate intoa soap dispenser a hero.
But, no, being a herotakes only a few moments!
A few moments...
doing the ugly stuffno one else will do.
No!
Stand down!Hold your fire!
Wade, what did you do? Colossus, no!
You were right, Wade.You are not X-Men material.
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!
What was your first clue?
The hollow pointthrough that fuckhead's face?
That kid was abused!
You can always tell!We have rules!
You are not judge,jury or executioner!
Fuck your rules!I fight for what's right!
And sometimesyou gotta fight dirty!
You let me downfor the last time, Wade.
Okay,get these guys in the pod.
Take them to the Ice Box.
Hey, baby!
I wonder what gangI'll be in.
Yeah!
Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?Hi.
I've always seen myself as
more ofan East Coast Hufflepuff.
I've made a critical erroron my Airbnb reservation.
This is not what the websitelooked like at all.
I love the decor though.
I had no ideahopeless was a color.
Hard left, douchebag.
Please, after you.
Another disgusting minorityoff the streets.
We'll sleep well tonight.
Let's get a bagel.
Nighty-night,you annoying prick!
You're a long wayfrom your superpowers.

Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.
Not to worry,we're old friends.
Fuck!
I wanted to be a superhero.
Always wanteda real super suit.
What happened?
When was the last time you sawa plus-sized superhero?
Never.
The industry discriminates.
Fuck superheroes.
The thing thatpisses me off the most...
I never stood upfor myself in there.
My whole life.
I've been waiting for someoneto come and save me.
Nobody's gonna sacrificeanything for me.
I gotta start taking careof myself.
I have a mission now.
The first thing I wanna dowhen I get out of here...
burn the headmaster alive...
and then take a selfiewith his smoldering corpse.
Aw. That's, like,my favorite part of the Bible.
I don't havea sock puppet on me...
but what did he do to you?
Did he taste the rainbow?
I'd whisper it,but Skittles would sue us.
Fucker hates mutants.
He tried to beatthe genes out of us.
Nothing worse thana "pray the gay away" type guy.
Sick piece of shit.
Tomorrow, we'll findthe biggest guy in here...
and we'll make him our bitch!
What was that?
That is the biggest guyin here.
Fun fact about the Ice Box...
though no one's ever seen it,
they keep a monsterin the basement.
Right next to a huge,
steaming bowlof foreshadowing.
Look.
I can't protect you.
With this collar on,
my superpoweris just unbridled cancer.
Give me a bow and arrow,I'm basically Hawkeye.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I've got tumors to grow.Vanessa awaits.
I'll start by making usa shank.
Good listening. I stole that guard's pen...
and stashed itin the old prison wallet,
if you know what I'm saying.
I really hope I don't knowwhat you're saying.
I know it's in there,I just need to get it out.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I can hear yourummaging around in there.
Do they make Purellfor your ears?
And to update you
on the story reported earlier,
after a lengthy standoff
outside the Essex Housefor Mutant Rehabilitation...
two mutants were arrested
and transportedto the Ice Box...

Just leave me alone, kid.
Oh, great.
Well, hello there, new fish.
It's nice to see somefresh faces around here.
I've done somelight catalog work...
but, really, modeling is justa stepping stone to acting.
I was talking to him.Oh.
Have we met?I can't place your mustache.
Black Tom Cassidy. White Wade Wilson.
What's your superpower?Cultural appropriation?
You're supposed to bethe toughest cunt in here.
You don't looklike much to me.
First rule of the yard,fuckface...

Second biggest guy.
The last thing I needis more hepatitis.
Oh, it's slippery, too.This table needs a wipe down!
Can we get a wipe downon the table?
Kid, I think you pickedthe wrong side.
No, I didn't!He's my friend!
Zip it. We're not friends.
You're about to getdick-slapped.
I had so much fun!You were like...
And I was like,"Take a seat, shit dick."
Just let me die in peace.
We make a great team!
Oh, God! We're not a team.
Why'd you say that back there?We're friends, partners.
We're not partnersor friends.
This doesn't end with usriding into the sunset.
It ends with medying of cancer...
and you winning the Ice Boxaward for softest mouth.
There's only one personin this world
that I care about,and she's gone.
You wanna survive?
Stop trying to shankthe biggest guys in here...
and make friends with them.
Make friends with someone.
Anyone but me.
Maybe even Black Tim.
Black Evan, I don't know.
All I remember ishe was African-American.
System malfunctioning.
Cells 7, 12, 14, 27.
Back in your cells, you filthymutants! Get in there!
Cells 1, 3, 7, 8.
Searching.
Cell 04 located.
Door won't open!
On your fucking knees!
That was our cell.
What did I do to piss offa grumpy old fucker
with a Winter Soldier arm?
Get away from me, kid!
Listen to me! Go!
Hello, Russell.
Who are you?
I'm Batman.
Ooh!
Oh. That's got some zip.
Don't feel bad.Even I can't kill me.
Talk!
What kind ofspineless shit stick
tries to killa 14-year-old boy?
You might wanna start talking!
'Cause I got a long history offiring at times like this!
The name's Cable.
I'm from the future.Just walk away.
Oh!
So, you're from the future.
I havethree questions then.
One, is dubstep still a thing?
Two, do people still homebrew?
And three,does Dopinder ever find love?
Dubstep's for pussies.
You're so dark!
Are you sure you're notfrom the DC universe?
I love dubstep!
Is that a fanny pack?
I used to have one of thosein 1990-never.
Something to remember you by.
Give me that back!That goes with me everywhere.
Like the memoryof your fucking fanny pack!
Why are you protectingthe kid?
I don't give a fuckabout him...
and his Are You My Mother?complex!
What's this one do?
In every film,there's a moment
when the herohits rock bottom.
InCool Runnings,it was when John Candy's
prized bobsled broke.
InHuman Centipede,it was when those people...
signed on to be in that movie.
But in this film, well...
you're looking at it.
On your fucking knees, mutant.
Rock...
meet bottom.
I love you, Wade Wilson.
Ness?
Hey, Ness!
Ness, can you let me in?
Please! Please.
Jesus.
You're not giving mea lot of direction here.
I'm at the end of my rope.
Then I joined the X-Men.
I went to prison. I, uh...
Is it the kid?
Kids give us a chance to bebetter than we used to be.
The kid!
That's exactly what she meant.
Your heart needs to bein the right place.
I'm not gonnaabandon this kid.
He's never had anyone, ever.
I need to be selfless.
Yeah, but what doesthat mean?
It meansI'm gonna save Russell.
Maybe I couldn'tsave Vanessa...
but maybe I can save a robustteenager from New Zealand.
Yeah, but what I mean is,like, the world "selfless."
I literally don't knowwhat that means.
Jesus Christ.
Okay, look.According to my guy, okay...
those mutiesare being transferred
to a supermax, 80 miles away.
Great, I'll pick 'em offalong the way.
Hold your testicles there,buddy, okay?
We're talking aboutan armored convoy...
and a vicious super soldierfrom the future...
that is looking to turn yourskull into a fuckable ashtray.
You know what we need to do?
We need to builda fucking team.
We need 'em tough,morally flexible...
and young enoughso they can carry
this franchise 10 to 12 years.
A team ofhighly-skilled motherfuckers.
I'm talking about someOcean's 14shit. Rogue Two.
John Wick 3,but withthe original director.
My body is aninstrument of death.
Not now, Dopinder.
I could be of great use.
What's your superpower?
Courage. That's adorable.
Do you have the courageto check and see...
if there are enough sanitarynapkins in the dispenser?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorryyou had to see that,
although I'm gladyou heard it.
All right, I'll put outa call for resumes.
But we're not payingmedical or dental.
It's time to get backon LinkedIn.
Attention, all inmates!
Transport to Cross ForceMaximum Security
Mutant Containment Facility...
will begin at 0800 hours.
Inspection of your cellsand out processing
will begin at 0600.
Oi.
What the fuckdo you want?
That's my fucking pudding.
Fuck your pudding! You like pudding?
Hello?
I know you're in there.
Must be hardbeing the biggest guy in here.
Lonely at the top, eh?
They're moving us tomorrow.
Maybe I can get youout of here.
And we can makethe whole world our bitch.
We need a secret code.
No,that's stupid, Russell. Idiot.
We're a team.
We're like thugs,we're like gangsters.
I'm like Tupac,and you're like Ice Cube.
Supposedly,she can rap, too.
Yeah.
I like that.
Terrific,these are all terrific.
Meet Bedlam.
Cool name! Superpowers?
I can distortelectrical fields.
Including the oneinside your brain...
causing anxiety, confusion...
pain.
So, basically,you're Dave Matthews.
We can use him.
I'm Zeitgeist.
Cool. I like it.
So you have the power
to put your fingeron the pulse of society?
No.
No, I spit acidic vomit.
Oh.Do you want me
to demonstrate? DEADPOOL: No!
We'll takeyour word for it.
Thank you. Yeah. Listen,we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?
And this is the Vanisher.
But...
Vanisher!
Nice! Right?
He's not here, is he?
He may be running late.
My name's Rusty,but I go by Shatterstar.
That's good, yeah.
"Rusty" is terrible.Toughie.
So, uh, where are you from?The planet Mojo World.
So you're an alien, I guess. Bad name.
How does that, uh, help us?
I'm basically betterthan you at everything.
Just once, I'm gonna finda planet of people
that are worse than meat everything.
A whole bunchof functional idiots.
I'm gonna go there, and I'mgonna be their Superman.
Isn't that Canada?
You shut yourgoddamn trash mouth!
Meet... Domino.
What's your shtick? I'm lucky.
That's not a superpower.
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.
Yeah, it is. Really isn't.
No, it isn't.Yes, it is.
Told you.
Get out of my head!
I'm not in your head.
I'm in an11-year-old's bedroom.
Well, if you're so lucky,
then what are youdoing here with us?
I don't know yet.
What's that supposed to mean?
There's a reason why I'm here,and I'll know when I know.
Everything usuallyjust kind of works out for me.
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.
I don't know who that is.
You're hired.
Lucky me.
I like her!
And last, but not least...
Peter.
Am I gettingcatfished here or...?
Any powers you wannatell us about?
No.
I don't have one.
Um, I just saw the ad.
No superpowers at all?
Uh, I have bothType 1 and 2 Diabetes.
Ow! Oh!
That's all the diabetes.
Right?Yeah, you got 'em all.
If you find a Type 3,let us know.
Yeah.
You're in.
Yeah. Fuck!
It's fulfilling work.
Let's go!
This is Convoy 
departing the Ice Box.
We are en route.
Peacetime makes people soft.
I was born into war.
Bred into it.
Okay.
What's the most painyou've ever felt?
These restraints are pretty...
People thinkthey understand pain.
They have no concept of it
beyond their ownworst experience.
5 years old. That's what?
A bee sting.
Oh, yeah.
20 years old, shrapnel.
40 years old, disease.
Maybe the kind that leaves youmore machine than man.
Yeah, getting old'snot for sissies.
That's what myGrandma Ginny used to...
I've got a list.
We're gonna work down it.
Together.
Number one,I'm gonna bend something.
Something that was notmeant to bend.
I'm gonnastop you right there
because I'm not gonnamake it to two.
I won't evenmake it to one.
I don't do well with pain,you know.
If I stub my toe,I'm done for the day.
I cried when theycanceled Felicity.
When I get really scared,I get nervous erections.
I have one right now.
Don't look.It'll only make it worse.
I don't want youto hurt me,
and I'll tell youanything you wanna know.
Except for where they are.
Russell's in a convoyheading southbound
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.
The monster's with them.I wouldn't fuck with him.
You all know the plan.
Intercept the convoy,
grab the boy.But not inappropriately!
You know what,
I wouldn't fuck withDeadpool either.
Because he's built a team.He's unstoppable.
He has an ass pen.He'll stab you with it.
Watch out for this guy, Cable!
He's very short, 5'11".Not like in the comics.
And if we succeed,we all go home early.
So if you go afterthem, Cable, I warn you...
there's a wind advisoryin effect.
A little turbulent up here.
I don't know muchabout this Cable fella...
but I guaranteehe hasn't killed
as many peopleas melanoma has.
We're getting close!
As a former X-Man...
Trainee. Thank you, Bedlam.
I was always appalledby the blatant sexism
in the group's name.
X-Men! Men!
The point is, our groupwill be forward thinking.
Gender neutral.
From now on,we'll be known as...
X-Force.
Isn't thata little derivative?
I don't recall askingyour opinion, Peter!
That wasn't me.
Hang the laundry outat 1,300 feet...
intercept the convoy,and grab the boy.
Let's bring onthe carnage, baby!
Get me on the ground,watch me go!
Yeah!
I can't wait to kill!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
I just wanna sayhow proud I am of this team.
You know,you guys look amazing!
Vanisher, I have no doubtyou look amazing too.
This is the family
that I've always dreamedof having and I...
Ah, shit.
I just get a little choked upsometimes.
I hate to interrupt,but is anybody nervous
about the high winds?
Gary. My name's Peter.
I realize that you'renew to this, but relax.
You've been chosenby a higher power.
Did he just call himself God?I think he did.
I'd like to go home. And I'd like...
the McRib to be availableyear round,
but sometimes dreamsdon't come true.
I spent 10 yearsin Special Forces.
You think we didn'tjump out of the plane
because of a light breeze?
You're in this shit now,Mustache!
I'm only yellingto impress the other guys.
I'd never let anythinghappen to you, Sugarbear.
Leonard, hit it!
Go! Go! Go!
Let's get some!
Whoo!
Oh, yeah!
Convoy, 12 o'clock!On my command!
Deploy! Oh, hey now!
Whoa!
Little off course here.
Holy mommy fucking shit!
Ah, there they are.
Look at these gorgeoussons of bitches.
Oh, yeah!That's right, Bedlam!
No! Trippingmotherfucking billies!
Shatterstar.Okay, you got this.
Left!
Left!
You'd have to be insaneto take off in this.
No, stage left, you idiot!
Well, I guesswe found something
you're not better at.
Vanisher.
Maybe the wind can't blowwhat it can't see.
Oh! Really?
All right,we could do this with four.
Sugarbear.You got this, buddy!
That's the stuff!That's the X-Force spirit!
Never underestimatea man with a mustache!
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.
We did it!
You're a goddamnsuperhero, you!
X-Force!
X-Force.
Oh!
Peter.
I got you, buddy!
You're gonna be fine!This is not good, man!
You got this, big guy!Here we go, Peter!
Look at me.We're X-Force, right?
Yeah, we're X-Force. We're X-Force.
Oh, my God!What the fuck?
Fucking acidic vomit!
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw upin my mask.
Okay,I'm over the convoy.
Where did the restof the team land?
Good news and bad news.
Bad news isthe whole team is dead.
The good news is,
I don't think anyone'sgonna miss Shatterstar.
He was a bit of a prick.Oh, but Paul!
Peter!
Peter, I'm gonnamiss him most.
But there isa slight chance
Vanisher could make it.
Nope, no chance. He's dead.
The whole team?
Only the main ones.We're still good.
Fuck, you are dumb.
Whoever planned this stunt's
been smokinga lot jazz cabbage.
I'll tell you that much.
That's pretty obvious!
Looking good, Vanisher.
They're headedinto the tunnel.
I'm that kid's only hope,
so sit tightand wait for my word.
Whatever.
We're gonna lose 'em.I'm dropping in.
Uh, that'sa negative, sole survivor.
Luck is not a superpower!We are so fucked!
No, we most certainlyare not fucked.
Seriously,I don't get it!
What, you shoot luck lasersout of your eyes?
It's justit's hard to picture.
And certainlynot very cinematic.
I mean, luck?
What coked out,glass pipe-sucking
freakshow comic book artist...
came upwith that little chestnut?
Probably a guywho can't draw feet!
Once again, it all fallson my shoulders.
It's why I'm cursed to bea solo act.
Wander the Earth... I'm in.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
I'm in.
How in the fuckare you in already?
Oh, shit.
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.
Okay.
New plan. Use all of yourimaginary powers
to stop Cablefrom killing that kid.
I'm coming up on your six.
That gun is amazing!
Hey!Asshole!
Where is he?I can't see him.
He's on top of you.
He's tearing you open!
He's going inthrough the back!
Oh, God, he's inside!
You hear yourself, right?
Accidental double entendres!
Russell! Russell Collins!
Hands off that kid,John Connor!
No, no, no!
Shit!
Two can play that game!
Got it! No, I don't.
Showtime, mama!
Lady Luck, take the wheel.
I'd ask who you are, butyou'll be dead in a second.
I'm Domino, and doubtful.
Hang in there, Doms!
Oh, this is really hard.
And give me backmy Skee-Ball token.
You're doing great.X-Force.
I guess dubstep never dies.
Whoo!
You killed Black Tom,you racist son of a bitch!
That's unfortunate.
We got no brakes!
Figure it out!
There's nothing I can't kill.
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevinused to say...
"There's a first timefor everything, son."
Give me your best shot,One-Eyed Willy.
Those bullets were, like,super fast.
Here we go.
Domino, mind slowing us down?
Here goes nothing.
Knock, knock.
That's my boy.
Holy...
I'll be first to admit...
this did not goaccording to plan.
I'll also be the firstto admit that
that plan waswritten in crayon.
Looks like Russell founda new friend. Jelly.
Turns out Domino'sa bit of a badass,
and maybe,possibly mildly lucky.
But Cable? Ugh.That guy's in a mood.
A mood that is
about to getsignificantly worse.
Something is so terribly,terribly wrong.
Oh.
Oh, God, that hurt.
Suck it, Mel Gibson.
Russell.
Russell!
Russ, where are ya?
Russell. Russell, you're okay!
Oh, thank God.Oh, my God!
Juggernaut!
I thought that was you!
I should've wornmy white pants.
You probably get this a lot,but I am a huge fan.
Uncanny X-Men183. Thor411.
X-Men Unlimited12.
You know, it has always beena dream of mine...
to see my facereflected in your helmet...
as you charge at mewith murderous intent.
I don't mean right now.
I'm gonna rip youin half now.
That is sucha Juggernaut thing to say.
Oh, my God!I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel...
Oh, no, they're right here.
Got 'em.God, Russell.
I have a mission.
To get my revenge.
I'm going to burnthat headmaster alive.
You're not the revenge type.
Take it from a friend.
Friend? You were sick,and I protected you.
You said it yourself.
"I'm not your friend.Find someone stronger."
So I did.
Russell, I couldn'tprotect you back then.
But I can now. What do youwant me to say, huh?
"I care about you"?'Cause goddamn it,
I care about you, Russell.
What's Juggernaut gotthat I don't have?
Don't you say legs!I know you're gonna say legs!
Legs! Still hurts to hear out loud!
What is that?That's not a real rope!
You get back here, young man!
Doms!
Doms, get meout of here, please.
Use my armsas backpack straps.
I think we may have found
your cosmic reasonfor being here.
I'm pretty surethis isn't it.
X-Force.
No child is hopeless.
Don't give up on the boy.How could he just walk away?
It was the coldnessin his eyes.
You should've heard it.
I guess familyreally is an F-word.
Rub my legs, Mama.
Why would Irub your legs?
Please, they hurt.I have growing pains.
What in the...
Why is your handso tiny again?
That's not my hand.
Oh! Mary,mother of Joseph!
That was nice for me.
Wade! I heard what happenedwith the convoy and...
Why wouldn't youcover that up?
A warrior has nothingto be ashamed of.
Yeah, but you do.Look at you.
You're juststraight shirt-cocking it,
toddler-style.
Oh, yeah.Full Winnie the Pooh.
The hell's happening?Describe it.
I wouldn't ask him to do that,if I were you.
It's like, um... Here we go.
It's like he wasgiving birth anally,
but they quit halfway through.
They got the legs out,and they said,
"You know what, I'm done."
Happy?
It's like he's a Muppetfrom the waist down.
But this time, you can see
the Muppet's dick.
Grover's got a cockthe size of a twig.
Mr. Weasel, I canno longer be double-parked.
I've had three ticketsalready.
No, no, no, DP,not again!
This has happened before?
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.
The indecision is killing me.
Why couldn't Godtake my hearing?
Oh. Wow!
Cool your pits.They're growing back.
I'm talking about your face.
I've never seen youwithout your mask before.
Jesus Christ! Looks like an avocado.
Your legs, though,they're cute.
You wanna borrowa pair of pants?
I'm glad everybody dropped by.
You must be wonderingwhy I didn't call you here.
I'll tell you why I'm here.
"The Time Traveler's Wife's"husband...
beat me withinan inch of my life.
He was torturing me!
But all I told him waseverything he wanted to know.
So, I'm hereto help us gear up.
So we can go after himwithout me.
No!
I'm doing this alone.
The Juggernaut
will kill you all. Fair enough.
I just need a couple ofhours to get some legs
under me. What will you do?
I don't carewhat the kid did to me.
I ain't letting Cableget to him,
even if I have toteabag him to death.
It's really just a sip of teaat this point.
Zip it, black Black Widow!I'm flowing.
The first orderof business is
to get me in front of Cable...
so I can pull all the fuckingblood out of his body...
and fashion his bonesinto holiday jewelry.
Then,I'm gonna take his skin...
and stretch it outover a homemade mating drum.
He's standing rightbehind you, isn't he?
What in the ass?
Is this apartment listedon Tinder? Grindr?
You picked the wrong shitholeto fuck, future boy.
Ugh. Is that really necessary?
No. It's his"Basic Instinct."
What can we help you with?
I'm here to proposition you.
Oh, boy!
He's really teeing it up,isn't he?
Who gets to makethe first joke?
I think we should all do itat the same time.
Good call.
For $45, you get sucky-suck.
I only do overthe pants, mouth stuff.
Fuck!
The Propositionhas a wonderful
Guy Pearce performance.
Wait, wait, wait!I wanna do mine over.
Give us the line again. I need your help!
Trust me, I'm even less happyabout this than you are...
but you unleashedthe Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!
I can't bring him down alone.
So here we are.
We're no longeraccepting applications
for X-Force, unfortunately.
Even if we were...
there's a wind advisoryin effect until at least...
We don't have a lot of time.
Your friend's aboutto make his first kill.
No offense,but if you know so much...
why not travel back to whenhe was a baby, kill him then?
Or better yet, head backa little further,
kill baby Hitler.
I use a deviceto slide through time.
The longer I travel,the harder it is to control.
I got two charges:one to get me here,
one to get me home.
Well.
That's just lazy writing.
Your boy'sgonna kill the headmaster
of the orphanage tonight.
After that,he gets a real taste for it.
Like 10-year-oldKirsten Dunst, motherfucker!
So he keeps killing...
and killing, and killing,
and killing.
Until one day, he killsthe wrong fucking people.
My people.
Relax.
I'm retrieving somethingfrom my utility bag.
It's a goddamn fanny pack...
and you know it,you sick son of a bitch!
The differenceis night and day.
You remind me of my wife.
I'm sorry.
I said, "You remind meof my wife."
No, I'm sorrythat you said that...
while making heavy eye contactand applying lip balm.
She always struggled.
But she was funny...
and filtered her painthrough the prism of humor.
Something I couldnever master.
It was my fault she died.
It was my jobto stop people like him.
I came close a few times.
He wasn't too happyabout that.
He was trying to hurt me...
and he knew exactlyhow to do it.
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand.
He came into my home...
and took the only thingthat made it a home.
Sound familiar?
I'm sorry.Uh-huh.
No, I'm really sorry.
But that isn't Russell.
It doesn't have to be him.If you knew what I knew...
Yeah, he's got anger issues...
maybe a smalllearning disability...
splash of diabetes...
but nothingthat can't be fixed.
If you could go back...
and stop the people that tookyour girl, would you?
No.
I'd buy them alla bouquet of hand jobs.
Of course I fucking would!
But I wouldn't kill a kid.
I'm not asking youto kill a kid!
I'll kill the kid.
I'm asking you to savehundreds of other kids.
Russell's gonna burn downthat orphanage.
And I can imagineyour dead girlfriend...
would want you to dothe right thing, wouldn't she?
So, what's it gonna be,handsome?
Give me a chance to save him.
What? You said...
once he kills someone,he gets a taste for it.
If we can get to himbefore that happens...
promise you'll give mea chance
to put himon a different path.
Define "chance."
I don't know.How long does it take
to save someone's soul?That's not...
I'll give you 30 seconds.
What? No! Best I can do.
Take it or leave it.
He's doing it!
Look at the little fella.He's doing it.
There he goes.
Jesus Christ!
Just shirt-cocking it.
Ugh.
There you go, little fella.
Go on, you're doing it!
My beautiful, hairless,Twizzler-legged baby boy.
Christ!
That's disturbing.
30 seconds.
Deal.Deal.
Man, that sucks they didn'thave anything in your size.
I really wanted to match,you know?
Being a menacing team.
Oh, man, it sucks.
That was somecold-ass shit, kid.
And that is justthe first five steps
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.
Where the hellare we going?
You said it yourself.
Nothing can stop theJuggernaut. We need backup.
I will bathe in the bloodof your enemies.
Can you turn off the music?
You'll do no such thing.
Why don't you just say itin an Indian accent?
I'm sorry? Apology accepted.
This is a side of youI do not like.
Let me guess,
some of your best friendsin the future are Indian.
What the hell are you...?
Once again, intolerance rearsits ugly head.
I am so sorry.It gets better.
I'm not a fucking racist,moron!
That's preciselywhat a racist would say.
I'm with the old white guyon this one.
And that's a twist.
When this is over...
I'm going to fuck you to deathwith your own broken feet.
And a sexual predator, too.That's rich.
I should havefinished college.
So what exactly do you
do in the future, anyway, huh?
Some kind of soldier?
Yeah, something like that.
I was a soldier.Special Forces.
I bet 50 years from now,we're bestest buddies.
50 years from now,you're very dead.
Your entire generation fuckedthis planet into a coma.
Boom!
Spoiler alert.
Planets.
Next time, Uber.
Here's a spoiler alert.
You're not a fucking hero.
You're just an annoying clowndressed up as a sex toy.
Well, I got news for you.
My heartis in the right place.
Russell's notgonna kill anyone.
Because of me, he's gonna knowwhat real love looks like.
We're all going to die.
Because of you,I'll always know
what a grown manwith baby balls looks like.
I'm a grower, not a shower.
God, I wish this were a bus
where I could pullthe string and get out.
It's a good thingCable's not driving,
or you'd be in the back.
I am in the back.Right here!
I made mistakes!
I wanna take them back!
You trusted me.I took that trust...
and turned itinto a glory hole
in an airport bathroom.
The one in Minneapolis.You know the one.
But even you know I'm nota complete piece of shit.
I was once an X-Man.
Trainee!
You're still usingmy Velcro labels. Aw.
They do stick betterthan tape.
Hi, Wade!
Please don't.
Say whatever it is you're hereto say. Make it quick.
Right. Quick.
It's the kid.Just like you, I let him down.
And just like me,
he's never had anyonesacrifice anything for him...
because the whole worldwrote him off
as a piece of shita long time ago.
Look, he's teamed upwith the Juggernaut!
The Juggernaut!
Who's, like, my favoriteMarvel character ever...
And hi, Yukio! That was reallynice of you to say hi...
so I'm saying hi back.
You guys makea super cute couple.
Yeah. Where was I?
Oh, yeah. You should nevermeet your heroes...
because, honestly,he's a bit of a dick!
And like a lot of dicks,he's hard as a rock...
and causes nothingbut problems!
Look, you can stop theJuggernaut. I know you can.
Do you know what would happento me if I helped you?
I would be disgraced.
You are a criminal,a fugitive.
But worst of all...
you broke my heart, Wade.
Then you know what?
Your heart's inthe wrong place, big guy.
Doing the right thingis sometimes messy...
and fucked up, and notparticularly convenient!
So stay herein Chateau de Virgin...
while we go get our fuck on!
You're doing great.
So you wearthat helmet because
your brothertries to read your mind?
Yeah, but he's ina wheelchair, so even-steven.
Someone's coming.It's Russell, sir.
And he's not alone.
Secure the children.
They will not replace us.
What do you saywe go fuck some shit up?
"Let's fuck some shit up"is my legal middle name.
Watch my back.I've got the old man.
Amen, brother.
Time to make the chimichangas.
30 seconds.
I finally know why I'm here.
I was raised in this place.
Well, not raised.I was tortured.
Wow! It's your cosmic reasonfor being here.
Shall we? This is gonna be fun.
Yeah!
Hey! Been meaningto ask you...
what's with the dirty,disgusting hobo bear?
It's not dirt. It's the bloodof my dead daughter.
Are You Bear, God?It's Me, Margaret.
Give me some.
They saylaughter heals anything...
except, of course, that.
We should just cue the music.
Welcome home, Russell.We missed you.
Russell!
You don't need to do this!Let's talk!
Why are you dressedlike the Unabomber?
That's why!
Told you this little fucker'stoo far gone.
Zip it, Thanos!We have a deal and you fuck...
Hey!
I'm gonna shove thatcab driver right up your ass.
My body and my handsare so soft.
You should probablyhead back to the car.
I think I'll headback to the car.
It works bestwhen you pull the trigger.
That gun is amazing!
Say it!
You are an abomination!
Now, I'm gonna shovethe red guy up the old guy.
I believe him!Every man for themselves!
Gotcha!
Beat it, midget!
Hey, big guy,the sun's getting real low!
Oh, shit fuck!
Come here, beautiful.
Whoo!
Say it!
You came for me.
I'm not giving up on you,
and you are notgiving up on that boy.
Who says that rulesaren't meant to be broken?
It's time to fight dirty.
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.
Hey! Pick on someoneyour own size!
That's sucha you thing to say!
Go get him, tiger!
Big CGI fight coming up!
He's doing great.
Say it!
Russell.Bingo!
You see that bus?
I'm gonnashove it up your ass.
That's right!I'm fighting dirty!
Oh, great!
There they are!Those freaks!
A bunch of armedpedophiles in nursing shoes.
Can I haveone of those guns?
No.That's fine.
Get off this property,mutant scum!
I'm just gonnause this brick.
Maximum effort.
Who says youcan't go home again?
Oh!
Yeah!
Say it.
Say what you saidevery time you tortured me!
Say it!
Blessed are the wickedwho are healed by my hand!
Blessed are the wicked...
who are healed...
by my hand.
You commie motherfucker!
Oh, my God.Did you feel that, too?
Only best buddiesexecute pedophiles together.
You got 30 seconds,you jabbering butt plug!
Now we're getting it.
I need a busto get you all out of here.
Orphans.
Oh, geez.
It's time to burnfor what you've done!
A child should not be burdenedwith such power!
Russell! Wait!
Oh!
Wait! He hasn't killedanyone yet!
What more do you need to see?Don't you fucking dare!
He's just a kid!
Tick, tock. Meter's running!
I'm gonna melt you downand make a cock ring.
I told you! Leave me alone! Come on!
Listen to me!
That's how we do it
in Mother Russia.
They say millennials arethe hardest to reach.
Oh, no.You're doing amazing.
Damn, it feels goodto be a gangsta!
Go home, Wade!
You're ruining everything!
I'm getting good at this shit.
Go, go, go!
He dies tonight, Wade.
You can't stop me!
He even runslike a fucking pervert.
Like an online predatorwho lost his laptop.
There's one bullet leftin that gun.
Wait, wait, wait!Please, just give me a second!
I got this.
Russell! Stay back! Go home, Wade!
Let's talk. It doesn'thave to go this way!
That piece of shit...
he deserves to diefor what he did to you.
He hurt you badly.Makes you wanna hurt others.
But if you kill him, he wins.
You become everythinghe says you are, but worse.
You're just a kid.
You don't wanna hurt anyone.
How do you know what I want?
Because I've been inside you.
That came out wrong.
I've been inside your shoes.
Which is also off-putting.
It's not a great analogy.
The point is...
there are people...
There are peoplein this fucking world...
besides him,who will treat you right.
It isn't too late.Don't do it.
I never should've leftyou there.
I never should've left youin that prison.
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anybody!
Wonderful kid.
You can't stop me, Wade!
I got one more idea.
It's just a really bad one,even for me.
Wade, what are you doing?
All right. This is forall the marbles, kid!
You're gonna killsomeone today...
Blessed are the wicked...
...then it's gotta be me.
...who are healed by my hand!
Fuck this!
Tell me they got thatin slow motion.
Oh, that's not good.
No, sir.
You sacrificed yourselffor me.
Yeah.
And it was the best thingI ever did.
I told youI care about you.
You're a good kid, Russell.
Hey.
The bear.
It worked.
Because of you.
No, Wade, because of you.
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop!
Just let it happen, okay?
I guess my heart was finallyin the right place.
That riddleis so fucked up.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Don't be. Don't be.
I've been trying to makethis happen for a while.
Please, just don't leave me.
I don't wanna diewithout an audience.
We are not going anywhere.
Oh, God, I hopethe Academy is watching.
Just rest, okay?

Before I go...
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.
Domino.

Think everyone did.

And you...

Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.
And you, Cable.
You get back to your family.You tell 'em Wade says hi.

That's why it's high timethat you had a super suit.

But I did have to help a kid.Yeah.
He's got a terrible name. It's just awful.
Ugh. I tried to tell him.

You'll find out.
It's all right. I'll be here.
It's pretty fuckingawesome over here.
I can have anything I want.
Can every day beInternational Women's Day?
It is heaven.
I love you.
I know. I love you, too.
Now, go.
Go on. Go, get out of here.
Go.
Hey!
Kiss melike you miss me, Red.
Well, come here.
Don't fuck Elvis.
Ooh, too late. I'm sorry?
Time to make the chimichangas.
30 seconds.
Hey. Been meaningto ask you...

It's my daughter's teddy bear.
Her name's Hope.
Well...
What are you doing?
Somebody swiped right.
Tell me they got thatin slow motion.
You sacrificedyourself for me.
It would seem I...
Huh?
Genuine, high-grade lead.
You time-slidingson of a bitch!
You did this for me?
Wait. You can't go back.
You usedthe last of your fuel.
What about your girl,your wife?
Now, my family's safe.And I didn't do it for you.
No, I'm gonna stick aroundfor a while...
and make sure the world
doesn't shit itselfinto oblivion.
No. You did it for me.
No, I didn't.
You did. I really didn't.
Pretty sure you did.No, I'm positive I didn't.
Fine. All right,let's flip a coin. Okay?
Heads, you did it for me.Tails, you did it for me.
I'm not even gonna look,because you did it for me.
Say it again.
He did it for me. CABLE: Jesus.
We must get the collar off.Forget it. It's no use.
These collarsdon't just come off.
Wade.
I have an idea.
No, no, no!Let's not do that. Please!
I'd rather die of cancer.Let's just...
Oh, God! They do say the penis grosser than the sword.
We need the code.
Try, uh, seven?
Settle down,Captain Lucky.
It's not gonna be one number.
Oh, God, that's lazy writing.
I still got it.
Put that backin your prison wallet.
I don't know how to thank you.
But I do know how to hug you.
No.Yes.
Here we go. Bring it in.
Come on.
Pelvis to pelvis.
Let's go tip to tip.
There we go.The kids call this docking.
Is there a knife in my dick?
There's a knife in your dick.I'm just gonna back up now.
Yeah, yeah. No need to go full Yentl.
Gonna pretendlike that never happened.
Let's go home, Russell.
All you dirty mutants
are gonna rot in hellwith the boy!
Your soulsare beyond redemption!
Let's see your soul, perv!
No, no! No! No more!We're better than that!
We're better than him!
No more senseless violence!No more bloodshed!
We'll let karmatake care of him.
The day of reckoning is here!
I'm gonna miss him.He seemed great.
Whoo!
Courage, motherfuckers!
And karma, motherfucker.
I could hear youcoming the last 30 seconds.
I could barely keepa straight face.
I want some more.
I bet you do, Brown Panther.
We should leavebefore Fuckernaut wakes up.
Good call.You guys coming with us?
No, we'll get the kidsback to the mansion.
Besides, we're X-Men.
No, you're X-People.
You're exhausting.
I see what you did there.Puns.
Our door's always open.
That's kind, butI'm not ready to date again.
Let alone two women.
God, you're a douche.
Bye, Wade! Bye, Yukio!
What do you get
when you takeeight feet of chrome...
one pinch of courage...
a cup of good luck...
a dab of racism...
a splash of diabetes...
and a wheelbarrowfull of stage four cancer?
Answer: a family.
See? I didn't liewhat kind of film this was.
If there's anythingyou take away today...
other than the need to Google,"What the fuck is dubstep?"...
it's that we all needto belong to someone.
How somethingso small generates
enough energyto reverse time is...
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,
or I'll take itto the Genius Bar.
Cable's gonna kill youwhen he finds out.
Never heard of him.
Why do you thinkI'm helping him?
The Lord worksin mysterious ways,
don't I? A good day.
Bye, Wade!
Bye, Yukio!
That was probably a bad idea.
What have we done?
I hope we sharpenedthe cream cheese spreader.
I'll be right back!
We're definitely namingour kid Cher!
Whoo!
Peter!
Whoo! X-Force!
Walk away! Just walk away!
But we're X-Force! Nope! We're not.
X-Force is justa marketing tool
designed by Fox executives...
to keep Josh Brolin employed.
It doesn't exist.
All right, well,this has been pretty scary!
And I need to feed my cat!
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.
Okay. Will you giveDomino my email?
Wade, is that you?
I guess Stryker finally
figured outhow to shut you up.
Hey! It's me!Don't scratch!
Just cleaning upthe timelines!
Look, eventually you'regoing to hang up the claws...
and it's gonna makea lot of people very sad.
Huh?
But one day, your old palWade's gonna ask you...
to get backin the saddle again.
And when he does,say yes.
Oh, right.
Love you!
Goddamn, that's beautiful.
You're welcome, Canada.
Boy howdy.
Hi. This is a toughie.
Yeesh.
Oh, yes. You're alreadypracticing your salute, huh?
Yes, you are. Well, we'lltake care of that, won't we?
Jesus Christ! This isso much harder than I thought.
Oh, I'm going to hell.
That makes two of us.
You can do this.
This is crazy. This is crazy.This is crazy. This is crazy.
All right.
Maximum effort.
That's okay.Let me see here.
Oh, God.
That's why you'resuch a little bastard.
No one's ever changed you.
Yeah, you got a big, oldstinky in there, don't you?
God, it smells likeHitler's anus...
which would makes sense,wouldn't it? Yeah.
I think we both know
I don't havewhat it takes to do this...
so I'm just gonna changeyour diaper real quick...
and then I'm gonna come backwith my friend, Cable.
He loves killing kids.
